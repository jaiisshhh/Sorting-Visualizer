# 📊 Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer — a powerful and interactive tool built with ReactJS to help you see how popular sorting algorithms work! Whether you're a student, developer, or curious mind, this app offers a visual way to understand and compare the behavior and efficiency of different sorting techniques. 🎓💡

## ✨ Features

🔁 Interactive Visualizations of sorting algorithms

🚀 Speed control to slow down or speed up the animations

🔄 Shuffle button to generate new random arrays

🔍 Step-by-step animation of sorting process

📱 Responsive design for all devices

📘 Learn the logic behind each algorithm with in-app explanations

# 🧠 Algorithms Included

## Algorithm Description

⚡ Quick Sort A divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot and partitions the array
🌊 Merge Sort Recursively splits the array and merges them in sorted order
🧱 Heap Sort Uses a binary heap structure to sort elements
🔁 Bubble Sort Compares and swaps adjacent elements until sorted
📥 Insertion Sort Builds the final sorted array one item at a time
📤 Selection Sort Repeatedly selects the smallest element and moves it to the front

## Each algorithm comes with:

📚 A brief explanation of how it works

⏱️ Time and space complexity info

🎞️ Animated step-by-step sorting

## 🛠️ Built With

⚛️ ReactJS

🎨 CSS Modules for styling

📦 JavaScript for algorithm implementation
